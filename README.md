# Blib
Basics Library, not to be mistaken with Standard Library, is a STL for common functions and algorithms in Zig, similar to the "Basics" module in Jai.<br>
Blib will be a single file library just for nostalgia with C's single header libraries.

# Libraries
- Dynamic Arrays
- Allocated Strings
- RNGs
- Easier Input Ouput
- Easier File System
